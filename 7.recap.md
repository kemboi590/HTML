# Recap of HTML Topics

## 1. Structure and Formatting

- HTML documents start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Text formatting elements:
  - Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>` for hierarchical structure.
  - Paragraphs: `<p>` for blocks of text.
  - Bold and Italics:
    - `<strong>` and `<em>` for semantic emphasis.
    - `<b>` and `<i>` for visual styling.
  - Underline: `<u>` for underlined text.
  - Line breaks: `<br>` for breaking lines.
  - Horizontal rules: `<hr>` for thematic breaks.

## 2. Attributes

- Attributes provide additional information about elements.
- Common attributes:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for an element.
  - `class`: Used for grouping elements for styling or scripting.
  - `style`: Inline CSS for styling.
  - `title`: Tooltip text.
  - `href`: Links in `<a>` tags.
  - `src`: Source for images in `<img>` tags.
  - `target`: Specifies where to open links (`_blank`, `_self`).

## 3. Lists

- **Unordered Lists**: `<ul>` with `<li>` for bullet points.
- **Ordered Lists**: `<ol>` with `<li>` for numbered items.
  - Custom types: `type="i"`, `type="a"`, etc.
- **Description Lists**: `<dl>` with `<dt>` (term) and `<dd>` (description).

## 4. Tables

- Tables are created using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>`.
- Attributes:
  - `border`: Adds a border to the table.
  - `cellspacing`: Adjusts spacing between cells.
  - `colspan` and `rowspan`: Merge cells across columns or rows.
- Styling:
  - Use inline styles like `width` and `height` for resizing.

## 5. Forms

- Forms collect user input using `<form>`.
- Common input types:
  - Text: `<input type="text">`
  - Email: `<input type="email">`
  - Password: `<input type="password">`
  - Radio buttons: `<input type="radio">`
  - Checkboxes: `<input type="checkbox">`
  - Textarea: `<textarea>`
  - Dropdowns: `<select>` with `<option>`.
- Buttons:
  - Submit: `<input type="submit">`
  - Custom actions: `<button>`.

## 6. Semantics

- Semantic elements provide meaning to the content:
  - Examples: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`.
- Non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>` lack inherent meaning.
- Semantic elements improve accessibility and SEO.
