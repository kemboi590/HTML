## What are Semantic Elements?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of **non-semantic** elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of **semantic** elements: `<img>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.
